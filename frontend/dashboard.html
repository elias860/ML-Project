                    <h3>About the System</h3>
                    <p>The Student Risk Prediction System has been developed to address the critical need for early identification of students who may be at risk academically. By analyzing multiple factors including health status, attendance records, scholarship standing, and academic performance (GPA), this system provides educational institutions with a powerful tool to proactively support students before they face serious academic challenges. The system employs advanced machine learning techniques to process student data and generate comprehensive risk assessments, enabling targeted interventions and support strategies.</p>

                <div class="info-block">
                    <h3>How It Works</h3>
                    <p>The system operates through a sophisticated two-step process. Initially, it processes uploaded student data through a machine learning model that analyzes various student metrics including health conditions, attendance patterns, scholarship status, and academic performance indicators. After processing, the system generates detailed visualizations that provide comprehensive insights into student risk levels. These visualizations include distribution analyses, correlation studies between different factors, and trend analyses, allowing educators to make data-driven decisions in supporting student success. The interactive dashboard enables users to upload data, view predictions, and analyze various aspects of student performance through multiple analytical charts.</p>

                    <h3>User Registration Information</h3>
                    <p>Render platform requires a subscription for everything to work properly and quickly. You may notice that the system you are using takes about a minute to half a minute to allow you to register and log in. Yes, that is normal.</p>
                    <p>They do this to get the developer to subscribe. But as you know, the system you are using is just an experimental system. However, in the real system, some money will definitely be paid to improve the user experience.</p>

                    <h3>Future Development</h3>
                    <p>This system will be developed in the future to include more features to understand how to improve students' academic performance. A feature will also be added that will enable the system to send emails to students who are currently studying, informing them of any areas they need to improve to improve their academic performance. Currently, in this system, it is not possible to add students' emails and activate this feature, as this system is based on random data and is for experimental purposes only.</p>
